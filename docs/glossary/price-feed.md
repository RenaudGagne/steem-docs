# Price Feed

The function of the **price feed** is to allow [SBD](/glossary/steem-backed-dollars.md)/[STEEM](/glossary/steem.md) forced conversion which maintains the Steem-Backed Dollar peg to at least 1 USD.

On the [Steem Blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), it is maintained by [witnesses](/glossary/witness.md). The feed of a particular witness can be set automatically with a piece of software called a script who takes the price of STEEM on various cryptocurrency exchange API. The official price feed that will allow the forced conversion is the median price of all the top 21 witnesses price feed put together in the last 3.5 days.
