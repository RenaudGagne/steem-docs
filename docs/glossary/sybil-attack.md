# Sybil Attack

A Sybil attack, in the context of the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/sybil-attack.md) is when an attacker creates a large number of [account](/glossary/account.md), using them to gain a disproportionately large influence on the [reward pool](/glossary/reward-pool.md) and by default the ranking of content.

This problem is largely mitigated by the [reward curve](/glossary/reward-curve.md) and the [Resource Credit](/glossary/resource-credits.md) system since one cannot create a large amount of account to influence the reward pool in such as way.
