# Mana

Users are allotted a fixed amount of voting power which is **mana**. **Mana** is multiplied by a userâ€™s [vesting tokens](/docs/glossary/vests.md) to determine how much share in the [reward pool](/docs/glossary/reward-pool) should be allocated to a given [post](/docs/glossary/post.md) or [comment](/docs/glossary/comment.md). Every [vote](/docs/glossary/voting.md) that is
cast uses a percentage of their remaining **mana**. Users can vote for more posts, but *each vote will
be worth less*, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again. **Mana** recharges at a fixed
linear rate of 20% per day.
