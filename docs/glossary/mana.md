# Mana

Each user [account](/glossary/account.md) is allotted a fixed amount of voting power which is called **mana**. **Mana** is multiplied by a user’s [vesting tokens](/glossary/vests.md) to determine how much share in the [reward pool](/glossary/reward-pool) should be allocated to a given [post](/glossary/post.md) or [comment](/glossary/comment.md). Every [vote](/glossary/voting.md) that is cast uses a percentage of their remaining **mana**. Users can vote for more posts, but *each vote will be worth less*, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again. **Mana** recharges at a fixed linear rate of 20% per day.
