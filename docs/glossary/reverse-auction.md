# Reverse Auction

A reverse auction is a type of auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed. In an ordinary auction (also known as a 'forward auction'), buyers compete to obtain goods or services by offering increasingly higher prices. In the context of the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), **reverse auction** is how [curators](/glossary/curator.md) compete for the curation rewards on any given post created by [authors](/glossary/author.md).

## How Curation Reverse Auction Works

The curation "game" works as a **reverse auction**. If a [vote](/glossary/voting.md) comes immediately after a post is made, then 99.94% of it will be sent back to the [reward pool](/glossary/reward-pool.md), after 7.5 minutes 50% and after 15 minutes 0%. Curators must figure out when is best to vote based on how a given article has a chance of becoming popular.
