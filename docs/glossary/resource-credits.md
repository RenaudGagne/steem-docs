## Resource Credits (RC)

**Resource Credits** or RC in short were introduced in September 25th 2018 through [Hardfork 20 - Velocity](https://github.com/steemit/steem/releases/tag/v0.20.2) as an improvement to the bandwidth mechanism of the [Steem blockchain](/docs/glossary/steem-blockchain.md).

The RC Plugin defines blockchain resources and limits medium and long term use through stake-based **Resource Credits**. The amount of RC an account has is defined based on the amount of [VESTS](/docs/glossary/vests.md) as account as (also see [Steem Power](/docs/glossary/steem-power.md)). Based on the usage of a particular resource, there will be a market price in **RC**.
