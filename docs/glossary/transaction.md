# Transaction

From a technical point of view, the most fundamental definition of a transaction is an atomic event that is allowed by the underlying protocol. In a [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md), it is a event that is broadcast to the network and collected into [blocks](/glossary/block.md). In the case of the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), transactions include:
- [Voting](/glossary/voting.md)
- [Resteem](/glossary/resteem.md) (sharing a blogpost)
- [Posting](/glossary/posting.md)
- [Transfer of funds](/glossary/transfer.md)
- [Powering up](/glossary/power-up.md) / [Powering down](/glossary/power-down.md)
- Locking up funds in [Saving Account](/glossary/saving-account.md)
- [Delegating Steem Power](/glossary/delegation.md)
- Market Order on the [Internal Market](/glossary/internal-market.md)
- Sending encrypted [memos](/glossary/memo.md)
- [Claiming Rewards](/glossary/reward-claim.md)
- Changing the [Owner Key](/glossary/owner-key.md)
- [Following](/glossary/following.md) another [account](/glossary/account.md)
- [Creating an account](/tutorial/account-creation.md)

Each transaction are indexed with a [transaction hex](/glossary/transaction-hex.md) that is unique and allows anyone to prove that a particular event has happened. [Steemd.com](https://steemd.com) displays a record of every single transaction that ever happened on the blockchain.
