# Account

On the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), each user has at least one **account** that can be used to interact with the [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md). Each account has an address that is human readable (aka @username). Once an **account** is registered on the blockchain, all [transactions](/glossary/transaction.md)([upvotes](/glossary/upvoting.md), [posts](/glossary/posting.md), [comments](/glossary/commenting.md), [transfers](/glossary/transfer.md)) can be audited through a block explorer such as [steemd](/glossary/steemd.md).

Each **account** has 4 sets of keys. Each set having a [public](/glossary/public-key.md) and [private](/glossary/private-key.md) version. 

- [Posting Keys](/glossary/posting-key.md)
- [Active Keys](/glossary/active-key.md)
- [Owner Keys](/glossary/owner-key.md)
- [Memo Keys](/glossary/memo-key.md)

Each types of keys allow for specific kind of transactions to be performed on the network.
