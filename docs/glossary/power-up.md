# Power Up

On the [Steem blockchain](/docs/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), transferring from [STEEM](/docs/glossary/steem.md) to [Steem Power](/docs/glossary/steem-power.md) is referred to as “powering up,” while transferring from SP to STEEM is referred to as “[powering down](/docs/glossary/power-down.md)".

When a user is **powering up**, he is commiting his [STEEM](/docs/glossary/steem.md) to a thirteen-week vesting schedule in exchange for special privileges on the network. STEEM that has been committed to a thirteen-week vesting schedule is called Steem Power(SP) by users at large but on the blockchain level, it is accounted for as [VESTS](/docs/glossary/vests.md).
