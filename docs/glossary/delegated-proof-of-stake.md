# Delegated Proof-Of-Stake

**Delegated Proof-Of-Stake** (DPOS in short) is the concensus protocol of the [Steem blockchain](/docs/glossary/steem-blockchain.md). [Vested token holders](/docs/glossary/vests.md) ([Steem Power](/docs/glossary/steem-power.md) holder) elect 21 [Witnesses](/docs/glossary/witness.md) to validate transactions and act as a form of digital democracy.
