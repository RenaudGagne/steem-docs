# TestNet

A **testnet** is an alternative [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), to be used for *testing*. A **testnet** is often used to prepape for an eventual [hardfork](/glossary/hardfork.md). Testnet coins are ficticious and distinct from actual the [MainNet](/glossary/mainnet.md) tokens.

A **testnet** must be restarted every 90 days or so because thereâ€™s an intentionally hardcoded supply and block limit to keep the **testnet** token from becoming a viable token.

There are multiple advantages of running a **testnet**, developers can test theirs scripts or applications without the load from the live network this in turn allows much more flexibility to try new things. Having access to a **testnet** also helps you to work on new features and possibly submit new or improved pull requests to official the [Steem GitHub repository](https://github.com/steemit/steem/).
