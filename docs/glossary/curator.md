# Curator

A **curator**, on the [Steem blockchain](/docs/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), is a user that [votes](/docs/glossary/voting.md)on the content generated by [authors](/docs/glossary/author.md) on the network.

## Curation Rewards

The STEEM token [reward pool](/docs/glossary/reward-pool.md) is splitted  as follow:

- 25% to **curators**
- 75% to [authors](/docs/glossary/author.md)

This means that for each posts, 25% of the reward goes to **curators. The more a given curator has accumulated [VESTS](/docs/glossary/vests.md) (also called [Steem Power](/docs/glossary/steem-power.md)), the more rewards they will tend to accumulate. 

## Reverse Auction

The curation "game" works as a [reverse auction](/docs/glossary/reverse-auction.md). If a vote comes immediately after a post is made, then 99.94% of it will be sent back to the reward pool, after 7.5 minutes 50% and after 15 minutes 0%. **Curators** must figure out when is best to vote depending how a given article has a chance of becoming popular.
