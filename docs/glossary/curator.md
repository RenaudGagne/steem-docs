# Curator

A **Curator**, on the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), is a user that [votes](/glossary/voting.md) on the content posted by [authors](/glossary/author.md) on the network.

## Curation Rewards

After 7 days, a payout is released to the [author(s)](/glossary/author.md) as well **curators** who voted on the content. The [reward pool](/glossary/reward-pool.md) distributes payout each post as follow:

- 25% goes to **curators**
- 75% goes to [authors](/glossary/author.md)

The more a given curator has accumulated [VESTS](/glossary/vests.md) (also called [Steem Power](/glossary/steem-power.md)), the more rewards they will tend to accumulate through their curation efforts. 

## Curation Rules - Reverse Auction

The curation "game" works as a [reverse auction](/glossary/reverse-auction.md). If a vote comes immediately after a post is made, then 99.94% of it will be sent back to the reward pool, after 7.5 minutes 50% and after 15 minutes 0%. **Curators** must figure out when is best to vote depending on how much a given article has a chance of becoming popular.
