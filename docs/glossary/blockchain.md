> A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order, it allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. Each node (a computer connected to the network) gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically.[1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp#ixzz5Sajkhm2H)

The [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) is a unique type of blockchain that uses [Delegated Proof-Of-Stake](/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake.md). It is specifically designed to operate as a decentralized content management platform with 3-second confirmation and fee-less transactions.
