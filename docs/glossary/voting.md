## Voting

Core to the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) logic is the action of **voting**. There are 2 types of votes on the network:

- Vote for [witnesses](/glossary/witness.md) to be block validators
- Vote for content

The fundamental unit of account on the Steem platform is [STEEM](/glossary/steem.md), a cryptocurrency token. Steem operates on the basis of one-STEEM, one-vote. Under this model, individuals who have contributed the most to the platform, as measured by the amount of [vested tokens](/glossary/steem-power.md) in their account, have the most influence over how contributions are scored and which witness becomes approved by the community (the top 21 witnesses).

## Token Rewards

Token rewards are distributed by the amount of [VESTS](/glossary/vests.md) backing the votes on a given article. How much is distributed is dictated by the token's [reward curve](/glossary/reward-curve.md), [reward pool](/glossary/reward-pool.md) and how many people are competing for it as well as each users [MANA](/glossary/mana.md). 

## Upvotes & Downvotes

When content is published by [authors](/glossary/author.md) it is then available for applications to be display on their website. Users ([curators](/glossary/curator.md) in this context) can upvote or downvote(also known as flagging) depending on whether they appreciate the content or find it abusive (spam, plagia, etc.)
