# Posting
Core to the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) logic is the action of **posting**. Posts are created by [authors](/glossary/account.md) and then submitted to the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) via one of the many front-end application available on the network. From there, the content is available for developers to display on their application as well as for [curators](/glossary/curator.md) to [upvote](/glossary/voting.md) or [downvote](/glossary/voting.md) the content.

The Steem blockchain will always contain the full edit history of posts and comments. The size of a post is limited to about 64,000 characters including formatting.

## Posting Authority

This type of [transaction](/glossary/transaction.md) requires the user to enter their [private](/glossary/private-key.md) [posting key](/glossary/active-key.md) in order to be broadcasted to the network.
