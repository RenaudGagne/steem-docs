If [STEEM](/docs/glossary/steem.md) is viewed as ownership in the whole supply of tokens, then a token-convertible dollar can be viewed as debt since it is a promised to return $1 worth of STEEM at a later debt.

A rapid change in the value of STEEM can dramatically change the debt-to-ownership ratio. The blockchain prevents the debt-to-ownership ratio from getting too high by stopping to printing of **Steem-Backed Dollars** when the debt level exceeds 10%.
