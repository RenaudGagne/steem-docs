# Posting Key

The **posting key** is used for [posting](/glossary/posting.md) and [voting](/glossary/voting.me) on the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md).  Everytime a user post and vote through their [account](/glossary/account.md), he/she is signing each [transaction](/glossary/transaction.md) with their **posting [private keys](/glossary/private-key.md)**. Then, the system validates the transactions by using the **posting [public key](/glossary/public-key.md)**. Authenticated transactions are added to the [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md), while non-authenticated ones are rejected.

## Finding and Changing a Posting Key

A user can find their public **posting key** by going to https://steemd.com/@your_username under the "Authority" widget. Alternatively, he/she can find their private and public **posting key** by going to https://steemit.com/@your_username/permissions. 

Finally, a user can change their public and private **posting key** by changing the password of their [owner's key](/glossary/owner-key.md)
