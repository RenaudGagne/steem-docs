# Reward Curves

The reward curve is a parameter that it set within a given [Smart Media Token](/docs/glossary/smart-media-tokens.md) to define *how to divide the token-wide rewards among posts*. 

The reward curve can be *linear or quadratic*.

For [STEEM](/docs/glossary/steem.md) itself, curation was originally the quadratic, as of the Steem [hardfork 19](https://github.com/steemit/steem/releases/tag/v0.19.0) it is the linear.

**Note**: You can find more information about reward curve on the [SMT whitepaper](https://smt.steem.io/smt-whitepaper.pdf) on page 35.
