# Reward Curves

The reward curve is a parameter that it set within a given [Smart Media Token](/glossary/smart-media-tokens.md) to define *how to divide the token-wide rewards among posts who have been voted on*.  

The reward curve can be *linear or quadratic*.

For [STEEM](/glossary/steem.md) itself, curation was originally the quadratic curve, as of the Steem [hardfork 19](https://github.com/steemit/steem/releases/tag/v0.19.0) it is the linear.
