# Saving Account

A **Saving Account** in the context of the [Steem Blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) is a way for a user [accounts](/glossary/account.md) to secure their tokens through a time-lock mechanism.  If a userâ€™s active or owner key is compromised, the attacker has full access to all of the funds in their account. Because [blockchain transactions](/glossary/transaction.md) are irreversible, users usually have no way to get their funds back after they have been stolen. The Steem blockchain allows users to store their [STEEM](/glossary/steem.md) and [SBD](/glossary/steem-backed-dollars.md) in a **savings account**, so that the funds may not be withdrawn until after a three day waiting period.
