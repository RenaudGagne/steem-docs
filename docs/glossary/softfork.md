# Softfork

A **softfork**, as it relates to [blockchain technology](/glossary/blockchain.md), is a backward compatible method of upgrading a blockchain. Since old nodes will recognize the new [blocks](/glossary/block.md) as valid, a **softfork** is backward-compatible. **Softforks** do not require nodes on the network to upgrade to maintain consensus, because all blocks on the softforked blockchain follow the old set of consensus rules as well as the new ones. This requires, on the [Steem Blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) all 21 [witnesses](/glossary/witness.md) to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software but failure to upgrade the software **won't** cause major disruption or divergence of the blockchain.
