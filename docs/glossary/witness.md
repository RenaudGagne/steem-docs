# Witness

A Steem **witness** is a person or a group who runs a server on the Steem Network. **Witnesses** are core to the [Delegated Proof-of-Stake](/docs/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake.md) consensus protocol.

The main job of a **witness** is to:
- Validate blocks of transactions
- Store the data of the [blockchain](/docs/glossary/blockchain.md)
- Review proposed softfork/hardfork and come to a consensus
- Publish a price feed

There are 21 elected **witnesses** based on the votes of [vested token holders](/docs/glossary/vests.md).  The Steem community votes for **witnesses** based on the value they bring to the network.

All other **witnesses** who do not make it to the top 21 act as backup servers and may end up validating blocks when an elected witness server is down or missing blocks.

## Witness Reward

When a witness validates a block of transactions, he receives a reward. 10% of all the new tokens being created by the [Steem blockchain](/docs/glossary/steem-blockchain.md).
