# Witness

A Steem **witness** is a person or a group who runs a server on the [Steem Network]((/glossary/steem-blockchain.md)). **Witnesses** are core to the [Delegated Proof-of-Stake](/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake.md) consensus protocol. The main job of a **witness** is to:
- Validate [blocks](/glossary/block.md) of transactions
- Store the data of the [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md)
- Review proposed [softforks](/glossary/softfork.md)/[hardfork](/glossary/hardfork.md) and come to a consensus
- Publish a [price feed](/glossary/price-feed.md)

There are 21 elected **witnesses** based on the votes of [vested token holders](/glossary/vests.md).  The Steem community votes for **witnesses** based on the value they bring to the network. All other **witnesses** who do not make it to the top 21 act as backup servers and may end up validating blocks when an elected witness server is down or missing blocks.

## Witness Reward

When a witness validates a block of transactions, he receives a reward. 10% of all the new tokens being created by the Steem blockchain.
