# Smart Media Tokens

Introduced in a whitepaper in the end of 2017, **Smart Media Tokens** is a protocol that allow people to create their own tokens on the [Steem blockchain](/docs/glossary/steem-blockchain.md). These **Smart Media Tokens** (SMT in short) leverage all of the functionalities of the [Proof-Of-Brain](/docs/glossary/proof-of-brain.md) distribution mechanism while allowing for specification such as:

- Total supply of tokens
- Max supply of tokens
- [Inflation](/docs/glossary/inflation.md) rate
- [Reward Curve](/docs/glossary/reward-curve.md)
- Initial Distribution
- etc.

SMTs can also be leveraged for [Initial Coin Offerings](/docs/glossary/initial-coin-offering.md).

## SMTs Release Date
- January 15, 2019 - **SMT** development complete and live on the TestNet.
- March 24, 2019 - **SMT** fully released and live on the Steem Blockchain.
