# Reward Pool

A **Reward Pool** is a pool of tokens dedicated to incentivizing content creation and curation. Of the supply of new [STEEM tokens](/glossary/steem.md) created by the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) every year, 75% of those tokens compose the “rewards pool” which are distributed to content creators and content curators. 15% are distributed to [vested token holders](/glossary/vests.md), and 10% are distributed to [Witnesses](/glossary/witness.md), the block producers cooperating inside Steem’s [Delegated Proof-Of-Stake](/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake.md) consensus protocol.

The STEEM token **reward pool** is splitted  as follow:

- 25% to [curators](/glossary/curator.md)
- 75% to [authors](/glossary/author.md)

**NOTE:** Each [Smart Media Tokens](/glossary/smart-media-tokens.md) has it's own **reward pool** with it's defined [reward curve](/glossary/reward-curve.md) independent of the Steem reward pool.
