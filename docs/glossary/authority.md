# Authority

All [transactions](/glossary/transaction.md) on the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) has to be signed with [permission keys](/glossary/private-key.md). Each set of keys give **authority** to perform a different set of transaction:

- [Posting Keys](/glossary/posting-key.md) - for [posting](/glossary/posting.md) and [upvoting](/glossary/voting.md) content
- [Active Keys](/glossary/active-key.md) - for [tranfers of funds](/glossary/transfer.md) with memos  
- [Owner Keys](/glossary/owner-key.md) - for full access and changing all private/public keys 
- [Memo Keys](/glossary/memo-key.md) - for encrypted [memos](/glossary/memo.md)

This means that an [account](/glossary/account.md) can share any of the permissions level with another account on Steem and have the **authority** to perform transactions on their behalf.
