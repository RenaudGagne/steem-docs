# Beneficiary Reward

Introduced in HF18, **beneficiary rewards** are a list of [account(s)](/glossary/account.md) that will receive a pre-defined share of the author's [rewards](/glossary/reward-pool.md) at the moment of [payout](/glossary/payout.md). People who receive a beneficiary reward can includes possible co-authors, referrers, hosting providers, blogs that embedded blockchain comments, and tool developers. This allows for various forms of collaboration, as well as a way for platforms that are built on top of the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) to collect a portion of the rewards from their users.
As of HF20 only 8 beneficiaries can be set per post.
