# Beneficiary Reward

Introduced in HF18, a **beneficiary reward** is a list of [account(s)](/glossary/account.md) that will receive a pre-defined percentage of [rewards](/glossary/reward-pool.md) at the moment of [payout](/glossary/payout.md).

It is often used by developers as a way to monetize quickly their applications to fund development. It can also be used when a group of people collaborate under a single account.
