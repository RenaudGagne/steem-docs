## Proof-Of-Brain

First introduced in the original [Steem whitepaper](https://steem.io/steem-whitepaper.pdf) as *subjective proof-of-work*, **Proof-Of-Brain** is the process by which people earn tokens by using their brain. 

There are two parts to the "Proof-Of-Brain" concept. First, [reward pool(s)](/glossary/reward-pool.md) designed to incentivize developers, content creation and curation. Second is a [voting](/glossary/voting.md) system that assess the value of content.
