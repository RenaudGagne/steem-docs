# Proof-Of-Brain

First introduced in the original [Steem whitepaper](https://steem.io/steem-whitepaper.pdf) as *subjective proof-of-work*, **Proof-Of-Brain** is the process by which [accounts](/glossary/account.md) earn tokens by using their brain. There are two parts to the "Proof-Of-Brain" concept. First, [reward pool(s)](/glossary/reward-pool.md) designed to incentivize developers, [authors](/glossary/posting.md) and [curators](/glossary/curator.md). Second is a [voting](/glossary/voting.md) system that assesses the value of content.
