# Internal Market

The [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) offers an **internal market** that works as decentralized exchange. The **internal market** allows users to trade their [STEEM](/glossary/steem.md), [SBD](/glossary/steem-backed-tokens.md) and [SMTs](/glossary/smart-media-tokens.md) through a public decentralized peer-to-peer market. Users are able to place [buy](#internal-market-buy-orders) and [sell orders](internet-market-sell-orders), and order matching is performed automatically by the [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md). There is also a publicly accessible [order book](#internal-market-order-book) and [order history](#internal-market-order-history) which users can use to analyze the market. Users can interact with the exchange directly using the blockchain API, or use a GUI such as the one on [Steemit.com](https://steemit.com/market)

## Internal Market Buy Orders

A *buy order* is a request to buy on the **internal market**.

## Internal Market Sell Orders

A *sell order* is a request to sell on the **internal market**.

## Internal Market Order Book

An *order book* is a list of buy and sell orders organized by price level. An order book lists the number of tokens being bid or offered at each price point or market depth. The blockchain also identifies the market participants behind the buy and sell orders, although the UI may choose to not display the information (the information is publicly available on [steemd](/glossary/steemd.md))

## Internal Market Order History

An *order history* shows all market participant open orders and canceled orders. If an order price is not met, it remains in the *order history* until those conditions are met or canceled. Not to be confused with *trading history* that only shows buy and sell orders that were successfully matched.
