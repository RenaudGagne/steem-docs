# Block

Transaction data is permanently recorded in files called **blocks**. Each **block** contains, among other things, a record of some or all recent [transactions](/glossary/transaction.md), and a reference to the **block** that came immediately before it. Thus a block is like a page of a ledger or record book. Each time a **block** is ‘completed’, it gives way to the next **block** in the [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md). A block is thus a permanent store of records which, once written, cannot be altered or removed.
