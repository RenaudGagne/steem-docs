# Hardfork

A hardfork, as it relates to [blockchain technology](/glossary/blockchain.md), is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid [blocks](/glossary/block.md)/transactions valid. This requires, on the [Steem Blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), all 21 [witnesses](/glossary/witness.md) to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. Put differently, a **hardfork** is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain.
