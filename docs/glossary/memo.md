# Memo

A **Memo** is generally a short sentence written down to help your memory or to leave a message to a person in same office/organization. In the context of the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blokchain.md), a **memo** can be attached to a [transfer](/glossary/transfer.md) of funds from one [account](/glossary/account.md) to another.

It is often used to transfer funds to an exchange or to track the reason what certain funds have been used for. But another use of **Memos** is to send encrypted messages. [Memo keys](/glossary/memo-key.md) are required for that purpose.
