# VESTS

The [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) has two units of account - [STEEM](/glossary/steem.md) and **VESTS**.  Users who commit their STEEM to a thirteen-week vesting schedule, are provided special benefits within the platform. When STEEM is "[powered up](/glossary/steem-power.md)", it is converted to **VESTS**.  The ratio "steem_per_mvest" can be found on [steemd](steemd.com), it is calculated by taking

`total_vesting_fund_steem / (total_vesting_shares / 1,000,000)`. 

## VESTS Holder Privileges
 
When users [vote](/glossary/voting.md) on content, their influence over the distribution of the [rewards pool](/glossary/reward-pool) is proportional to the amount of **VESTS** that they have in their accounts. Users with more **VESTS** have more:

- Influence over the [reward pool](/glossary/reward-pool.md) 
- Influence over the rankings of [witnesses](/glossary/witness.md) 
- Increased bandwidth through [Resource Credits](/glossary/resource-credits.md) 

**VESTS** holders are paid 15% of the yearly [inflation](docs/glossary/inflation.md). The amount of new tokens they receive is directly proportional to the amount of **VESTS** they hold relative to the total amount of **VESTS** across all users.

## VESTS & Steem Power

[Steem Power](/glossary/steem-power.md) *does not exist* on the blockchain, however, it is what is displayed on the UI in order to keep users from being confused.
