# Initial Coin Offering (ICO)

An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency space's rough equivalent to an IPO in the mainstream investment world. **ICOs** act as fundraisers; a company looking to create a new coin, app, or service launches an **ICO**. Then, interested investors buy in to the offering, either with fiat currency or with preexisting digital tokens like [STEEM](/glossary/steem.md). In exchange, investors receive a new cryptocurrency token specific to the **ICO**.
